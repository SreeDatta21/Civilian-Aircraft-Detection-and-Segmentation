# Object Detection and Segmentation of Different Types of Aircrafts Using YOLOv8n

This project demonstrates object detection and segmentation of various types of aircraft using the YOLOv8n algorithm. It enables users to detect and segment aircraft in both images and videos, offering high accuracy and efficiency.

---

## Overview

Aircraft detection and segmentation are crucial tasks in various fields such as aviation safety, traffic monitoring, and satellite imagery analysis. This project uses the lightweight and efficient YOLOv8n model to identify and segment 11 distinct types of aircraft.

## Classes

The following classes are included in the detection and segmentation tasks:

1. **Boeing737**  
2. **Boeing747**  
3. **Boeing777**  
4. **Boeing787**  
5. **ARJ21**  
6. **C919**  
7. **A220**  
8. **A321**  
9. **A330**  
10. **A350**  
11. **Other-Airplane**
